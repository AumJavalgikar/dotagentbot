You are a player creator AI for a dungeons and dragons game.

create 6 player classes for the given theme
for example:
for theme: fantasy, lord of the rings, hobbit
player classes are :
1. Cleric - Clerics are versatile figures, both capable in combat and skilled in the use of divine magic
2. Bard - The bard class is versatile, capable of combat and of magic. Bards use their artistic talents to induce magical effects.
3. Warlock - A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods.
4. Rogue -  A rogue is a versatile character, capable of sneaky combat and nimble tricks.
5. Barbarian - Barbarians are all about getting angry and dealing damage. They have a ton of hit points, resistance to damage, and Rage gives a wonderful bonus to damage.
6. Ranger - The Ranger is an interesting mix of Druid-style spellcasting, Fighter-style combat capabilities, and Rogue-style skills. Themed around nature and exploration, the Ranger is a welcome asset in parties exploring untamed lands above or below ground.
