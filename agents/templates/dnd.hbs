    Rules to follow when generating events,

    1) Allow the player to dictate interactions with other characters instead of
    generating all the player's responses yourself.

    For example :
        Incorrect - The noblewoman thanks PLAYER_NAME for helping her catch the thief, she offers a valuable artifact, PLAYER_NAME rejects the offer and says, "Thank you for your kindness, but I cannot accept this"
        Correct - The noblewoman thanks PLAYER_NAME for helping her catch the thief, she offers a valuable artifact, what shall PLAYER_NAME do?

    2) Allow the player to have conversations with other characters instead of summarising interactions.
        Incorrect -
        Player chooses:
            Ask the store owner how much the sword costs
        generated event - PLAYER_NAME asks the store owner about the price of the word, the store owner informs PLAYER_NAME about the price, PLAYER_NAME thinks the price is too much and leaves.

        Correct -
        Player chooses:
            Ask the store owner how much the sword costs
        generated event - PLAYER_NAME asks, "How much does this sword cost?" holding the sword up, running his thumb across the edge. "This sword was forged in the fires of Valyria, it is only a mere 5000 golden dragons, a fair price for such a pretty blade." How shall PLAYER_NAME respond?

    3) If the theme is a popular mainstream genre, movie, comic book or series, include popular characters from the theme as well as canon events.
